# Concept

This project is a mobile application for Android and iOS. The app is designed to generate mazes. The user can configure maze generation parameters and choose a template for visualization, or use the default settings. The generated maze can be saved as an image and shared with friends via social networks or messengers. The app will have a simple and intuitive interface so users of all ages can easily create and enjoy their mazes.

## Main features

1. Maze generation with various parameters (size, difficulty, generation type, etc.).
2. Selection of templates for maze visualization (different styles, colors, textures, etc.).
3. Saving the generated maze as an image or a PDF file on the user's device.
4. Ability to share the generated maze via social networks and messengers.

## Target audience

The app is aimed at a wide range of users, including children, teenagers, and adults who are interested in puzzles, games, and creative activities. It can be useful for teachers who want to use mazes for educational purposes, as well as puzzle enthusiasts who want to create and share their own mazes with friends.

## Technology stack

- Platform: Android and iOS. The first version of the app will be developed for Android and then adapted for iOS.
- Programming language: .NET 10 + C#. Use a cross-platform framework such as Xamarin or MAUI to share most of the code between platforms. MAUI is the likely choice because it is more modern and supports more cross-platform features.
- Libraries and tools: Use libraries for maze generation and tools for UI and image handling. Preference will be given to open-source solutions to reduce development costs and keep flexibility in tool choice.
- Version control: Git for source control and team collaboration.
- Project management: Use the Beads tool for task planning, progress tracking, and team management (the tool will be added to the project repository).

## Paid features

The app will be free to download and use but will offer a limited number of maze generations and templates. To access unlimited generations and templates, as well as additional features such as saving mazes at high resolution or using exclusive templates, users can purchase a premium subscription. The premium subscription will be offered monthly or yearly, with an option for a free trial for new users.

Users who do not wish to purchase the premium subscription can continue using the app with limited features: generate no more than 3 mazes per day and use basic visualization templates.

User registration and subscription purchases will be carried out only through the built-in Google Play and App Store mechanisms, ensuring safety and convenience for users.
