# Monetization

This document describes the monetization strategy for the maze generation application. The goal of monetization is to provide sustainable revenue to support and develop the app while keeping it accessible and appealing to a wide audience of users.

## Monetization model

The app will use a freemium model that allows users to use basic features for free and offers paid features and subscriptions to access advanced capabilities.

## Free features

- Maze generation with limited parameters. In the free version, users will be able to create mazes up to 5 times per day with any parameters.
- Saving mazes to the device gallery.
- Sharing mazes via social networks and messengers.

## Paid features

- All features of the free version.
- Unlimited maze generation with any parameters.

The following paid access options will be available to users:

- Monthly subscription: $2.99 per month. Subscriptions should not auto-renew; users must manually renew each month.
- Annual subscription: $29.99 per year. Subscriptions should not auto-renew; users must manually renew each year.

It is desirable to support regional pricing to make paid features more accessible to users in different countries. This part should be discussed before implementation, as it may require additional setup and ongoing maintenance.

This simple monetization approach should provide a stable income to support the app while not restricting users who prefer the free version. It is also important to regularly analyze user feedback and sales data in order to adjust the monetization strategy and offer the most valuable features to users.
